Kwm version 0.2-beta

Kwm is an window manager for X11.  See manual pages for
detail.

You can freely re-distribute this software.  See 'NOTICE'
about this issue.

This version is only a preliminary release, so will have
many bugs.  One of the 'known' bug is that kwm sometimes
failes to handle deleted windows properly.  Also see
'WARNING' section of the manual pages.

You can contact me by the following address, but also
note that I am not always willing to remove the bugs
you find (excuse me!) because kwm is only a 'side effect'
of my research work.  But any suggestions about its
functionarity or way of fixing its bugs are welcome.
Thank you.
