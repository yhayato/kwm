{"name":"Kwm","tagline":"KWM Keyboard Window Manager ","body":"------- What is kwm? -------\r\n\r\nkwm is an window manager for X11.  See manual pages for detail. This program wass originally made by Prof.Kuno at\r\nTsukuba University. (Please read the file \"README.1988\")\r\n\r\nYou can freely re-distribute this software.  See 'NOTICE' about this issue. But ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, as always.\r\n\r\n\r\n------- Before you compile... -------\r\n\r\nI didn't prepare any writeups which describe how to customize, compile and run this software. Because this\r\nprogram is expected to be used by the people who can read the codes by themselves:p\r\n\r\n------- SYSTEM requirements -------\r\n\r\nX11\r\n  X11R4 or later (if you want to compile kwm with X11R5 or before, some modification is needed but you can easily find out the way by refering the man pages of X11 or include file of X11.)\r\n\r\nOS\r\n  I've been using kwm with sunos4, solaris2, ultrix, HP-UX (9.xx & 10.xx), FreeBSD and linux. \r\n\r\n\r\n------- ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY -------\r\n\r\nThis program is not so stable compared to the other window managers. ( Because I don't care if it works fine in my environment. )\r\nActually, there are no boundary checks in many places.\r\nTherefore, this version known to crash if you open many windows. \r\nIf you find bugs, please fix them and send me the patches:)\r\nI'll include those patchs in the future releases ( if exists )\r\n\r\n\r\n------- Another \"VERY\" important thing -------\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this window manger with PCs, you have to check whether your keyboard can generate the correct key-codes or not with xev or some other utilities when you press more than 3 keys at the same time. As far as I know, most of the cheap keyboards can not generate the correct keycodes... But kwm seems to work fine with the most of the notebook PCs and workstations.\r\n\r\nGood Luck and enjoy hacking,\r\n\r\n  Yoshinari Hayato\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
